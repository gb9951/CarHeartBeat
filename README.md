Our assignment does not use any external frameworks or dependencies. It runs on pure Java 8.

To run our program you need only use the 'compile.sh' script in the root directory of the project.

Alternatively you can run the project by compiling and running the 'CarHeartBeatMain.java' file.

Our project is meant to be a representation of a potential Navigation System Monitor process that monitors the GPS and Navigation systems.

It achieves this by testing the Navigation class as a seperate process roughly 20 times.

While a somewhat crude implementation, it clearly demonstrates the Heartbeat Tactic in monitoring different processes.
